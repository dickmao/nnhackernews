Even filtering for people whose education and skills would make them useful, they had a large number.<p>One estimate that I saw said that a viable colony would require about 100,000 people to move over a century.  And a person leaving Earth can reasonably spend their life savings to do so.  The value proposition is essentially sell your house, use the money to move to Mars.  SpaceX is planning to make the trip barely above cost.  But don&#x27;t forget.  They will be landing on a planet where basic infrastructure, starting with energy, oxygen and tunnels, are provided by SpaceX.  That&#x27;s going to be billions per year.  Of course it will be a long time before that colony is self-sustaining.  But when it is, those infrastructure basics will be worth a lot.<p>As for a second contender, developing a rocket that can compete with SpaceX takes over a decade, and many billions of dollars.  And then when you try to travel to Mars, you&#x27;re going to be landing on a place where the infrastructure is owned by SpaceX.  Musk is likely to welcome the competition...and charge top dollar for fuel for a return trip.  So you&#x27;ll have to invest billions more.  And once you&#x27;ve done so, you&#x27;ll be competing against an established competitor who is charging thin margins.  And you still won&#x27;t be in that lucrative infrastructure business.<p>As for who owns it legally...I believe that the people who live there will claim the land that they settle.

But my general rule for most software positions is anything over a couple of weeks waiting for a senior candidate to make a decision and I&#x27;d tell them we will have to rescind the offer and move on (jr candidates is a week for me generally but there are exceptions).  I also offer fair salaries from the start and don&#x27;t play any games trying to negotiate, if the candidate says they want X more, I&#x27;ll see if it fits and if so give it to them, if not I won&#x27;t.  I generally don&#x27;t have that problem often though because I start with a strong offer within our limits.<p>If you know you offered a low salary for the experience candidate then first, shame on you, second fix it and see if that resolves it but be careful not to make it all about money.  A fair salary with fair benefits in a good environment will beat a slightly higher salary that has a blah working environment.  And senior candidates can tell from interviews which is which.<p>Easiest thing to do is reach out and just ask what is it that is hanging you up on making a decision.  Be up front and see what they say, maybe they were waiting for an offer that promised them a magic amount of money, which doesn&#x27;t even mean it is that different than your offer, but maybe it checks some goal box for them.  Or maybe they are waiting to see if a special company accepted them, usually you have to figure that out by reading between the lines as most people won&#x27;t be direct and say that.   Don&#x27;t do this via email or IM, get the person on the phone or video call and just have a talk.<p>As a counter to my argument, some friends that hire at other companies will not put a defined limit but they make every offer contingent on the position still being open.  So essentially if they make you an offer this week and you take 3 weeks to respond they may have filled it and so no longer have a position for you.  But they don&#x27;t push you to make a decision.

Memfault helps firmware teams find and fix issues before customers start calling (or worse, tweeting!) by providing a small &lt;3kB SDK to include in the firmware and a web dashboard to manage releases, monitor devices, and view crashes. In the software world, Crashlytics, Sentry, and other error monitoring systems have been offering similar solutions for years. Memfault is the first such solution for firmware.<p>Embedded devices today are very different from ones built 10 years ago. Then, a device would run a small piece of firmware in a while() loop, capture input, compute some logic, write to a small 7-segment display, and that was about it.<p>Today, new products have a wireless connection to the internet, a bright 320x320 full color LCD, a high quality microphone and speaker for Alexa integration, and sometimes even run machine learning or computer vision algorithms on device! Building hardware products in 2019 is a significant software project, it requires software tools.<p>The three of us met at Pebble in 2013, where we shipped 4 watches together. Chris and Tyler went on to work at Fitbit, while François went to Oculus. Each time, we found ourselves building all of our tools from scratch which slowed us down tremendously. Imagine having to build a log collection solution every time you want to build a new web app!<p>As a result of the effort required to build them, the tools available to firmware engineers are not up to the task. For example, the state of the art in debugging requires connecting a physical debugger to your board. To investigate an error report from the field, customers must be contacted, devices shipped back, and enclosures disassembled. By the time this is all done, flash logs have rolled over, variables have reset, and developers are left scraping together raw data from flash to debug the issue. It can take weeks to get to the bottom of an issue that would be root caused in minutes with reasonable tools.<p>We&#x27;ve long wanted to show people what Memfault can do without the hurdle of integrating our SDK into their code. Today, we are launching a zero code, try-it-at-your-desk version of our tool available at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;memfault.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;memfault.com</a> (click on the &quot;Try Memfault&quot; button&quot;). In about 5 minutes, you should be able to connect a ARM Cortex-M based development board and upload an error report using a GDB script. If you do not have a board, you&#x27;ll be able to interact with an example error report.<p>We could go in at length about the implementations (ask us questions in the comments!). One thing we&#x27;re especially proud of is the &quot;Globals &amp; Statics&quot; tab which lets you query the state of any static or global variable in your system. To get this to work, we cross compiled libdwarf to wasm via emscripten and used it to implement parts of an in-browser debugger which can be used to look up values for a known symbol given an elf file and a Memfault core file.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear what you think, and find out what other tools you&#x27;ve found helpful in this space.

That says to me the idea that competition will results in the best products at the lowest price points (the great-great etc comment that started this) is simply not the case except in a sort of platonic idealization of capitalistic competition that only imperfectly, when at all, plays out in reality.<p>I think you have trouble with the distinction between &quot;the best&quot; and &quot;good&quot;. In market terms, &quot;the best&quot; is that which the market chooses. If the market decides that cheap junk shall succeed, so it will. Quality and cost are at odds, obviously. In some cases the market will even choose <i>expensive</i> junk, that&#x27;s generally the success of effective marketing.<p>To understand why this mechanism is nevertheless desirable, we need to look at the alternative: A planned economy and design by committee. Those mechanisms tend to result in products that are neither good <i>nor</i> cheap. The real argument for capitalism isn&#x27;t that market economies are great (though they are), but that none of the alternatives have ever worked out any better.<p>Perhaps a technological revolution can usher in a better system at some point, but whoever advocates for that had better done an elaborate computer simulation first.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not even saying we should ditch that model of capitalist competition, though I clearly think it should be subject to regulation &amp; oversight that a pure free-market libertarian wouldn&#x27;t like.<p>The first thing to note is that regulation rarely fulfills its purpose without unintended consequences that require further regulation later on. Furthermore, regulation usually benefits the big guys, who can afford to deal with it.<p>That&#x27;s not to say you shouldn&#x27;t have any regulation. Market externalities can not be dealt within from within a market framework alone.

It has datastructures as intrinsic part of the language syntax (just like Clojure, i.e in F# [|,,,|] is an array and in Clojure [...] is a vector, so more or less the same thing). Furthermore, the type inferences concierges the developer through the regular bureaucracy involved with strong type systems so effortlessly that you seldom notice it ... unless your code does not compile, in which case it&#x27;s wrong somewhere and you need to fix it (which you needed to do anyway).<p>Ok, so for the sake of the argument, let&#x27;s say the syntax is equally light for F# and Clojure, and their support for immutability is in the same ballpark. And let&#x27;s remove the argument &quot;a type system is an encumbrance&quot; because that will only lead to situation specific debates - one side will say that massive refactorings are a pita without types, and the other side responds that in Clojure you can use data schemas and should have unit tests anyway. And those discussions never lead anywhere conclusive.<p>So, besides the above mentioned topics, is there anything general one can say of the distinctive advantages of these two languages in specific situations, including how their two different ecosystems and runtimes affect the calculus?<p>I suppose it&#x27;s extremely rare to have experts who have participated in any large scale industrial developments with both of the languages, but if there are, it would be really nice to hear their opinion.

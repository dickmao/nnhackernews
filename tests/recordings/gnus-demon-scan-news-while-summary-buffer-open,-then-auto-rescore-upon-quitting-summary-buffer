These platitudes often have the (unintended?) consequence of effectively serving as veiled gate-keeping: &quot;silly novice, you thought learning X was sufficient?

When I see students work in procedural (not even functional!) environments, they seem to piece together &quot;the puzzle&quot; of the programming task, whereas in OOP environments they often seem to devolve into strange taxonomical metaphysical questions &quot;Is a Car a Vehicle?

This does not bother me in the least bit. I am someone who craves alone time. That means no music, no podcasts, no computer, no noise, no people. I am quite happy with a book and a writing pad. I want to be left alone to have a certain kind of inward experience.<p>As a side note, I have always felt that the point of reading is not to remember everything you have read, it is more to shape the way you think. And we might remember more of what we read if we would stop reading about other people&#x27;s reading and productivity habits, and just keep to ourselves. But I digress.<p>Sometimes people ask what it is I am working on, or what it is I do by myself all of the time. The answer, of course, is not a whole lot. Ours is a society that celebrates participation and creativity, yet I feel no pressure to create for the sake of creating, or to share for the sake of sharing. And I do not feel guilty or lazy for not &quot;producing&quot; anything of note. If there is a hell, it is full of groups of people doing group activities, and I am required to participate and create and talk about whatever it is we are doing for eternity. What a nightmare.<p>To be sure, I have written plenty. But what I am driving at is that a lot of the writing or &quot;creative work&quot; I do is for my eyes only. Sometimes I think about sharing an essay, but I have to pause to ask myself if I want to share because I have something to say, or if I want to share because I am seeking validation. Most of the time, the desire to create comes not from some quiet space inside of me, but from the side of me that wants to be seen and heard. I find that the quality of my writing, or any creative work, is far better when it comes from the right mental state, rather than from an abstract sense of urgency that I should be creating something, anything.<p>On another note, having thought about this for awhile now, the deep need for solitude is part of who I am, but also a compensatory reaction to being connected all of the time. Whether we realize it or not, we spend the better half of our days in a sympathetic state. This has consequences, I think, that are different for everyone. Eventually, you have to deal with the residue of living and working at a pace that is often not of your own making. Sometimes you have to get your bearings before the creative spark comes back. That can take longer than expected.<p>In closing, it is worth paying attention to the kind of creativity that comes from helping a friend or lover make something better.

Works best if the products are very similar (I&#x27;ve seen this too - where the reviews, if reading them carefully, seem to refer to say a USB thumbdrive, but what is being sold is an actual hard drive, or memory, or sdcard, etc).<p>The other way, of course, is to sell multiple products with different &quot;colors&quot; (but each is actually a different product). Then you have reviews all over the map, all for the same SKU - or at least in the same general comment mix for the product being sold. So now you don&#x27;t know if the comment is referring to the product you want, or some variant of it...<p>All of that said, I can kinda understand why this is possible, even desirable - for Amazon to give that kind of control to the sellers. They could try to police it, but how do they police and enforce SKU usage and such, without also busting legitimate uses? That&#x27;s probably the difficulty.<p>There&#x27;s a similar problem with some sellers posting items up with insanely large prices (like a pack of gum for $10,000); from what I understand, this is done to prevent an item from being purchased when it is out of stock, or to keep the reviews (maybe in conjunction with SKU swapping?), or a few other reasons, with the idea that nobody will buy that product with such a strange high price on it (plus sorting moves it to the bottom usually). Unfortunately, this also screws up when you want to sort high to low prices, to find a possible &quot;better product&quot; that is priced higher because it is made differently and better than &quot;regular ole&#x27; generics&quot; (I faced this recently while looking for a shielded audio cable).<p>Here again, though, policing it would be nearly impossible - how is Amazon to determine that a particular package of gum isn&#x27;t worth $10,000? For that matter, maybe there&#x27;s a buyer out there looking for an elusive pack of gum and is willing to pay the higher price?

I doubt that would look any nicer with higher order functions. Specially if you want to get the same efficiency: notice how here we test that gcd(a,b)==1 as soon as possible. In general efficient comprehensions involve pushing any filtering as early as possible, so with higher order functions you get an alternation of filter with map&#x2F;flatmap.<p>Here&#x27;s a (probably lame) attempt at a Python higher order version:<p><pre><code>    flatmap = lambda f, l: [x for t in l for x in f(t)]
    
    flatmap(lambda a: flatmap(lambda b: flatmap(lambda c: (lambda d: [(a,b,c)] if a**3+b**3+c**3==d**3 else [])(int((a**3+b**3+c**3)**(1.0&#x2F;3)+0.5)) if gcd(a,c)==1 and gcd(b,c)==1 else [], range(b+1, 30)) if gcd(a,b)==1 else [], range(a+1,30)), range(1,30))
    </code></pre>
Maybe it would look nicer with some filters thrown in instead of abusing flatmap of empty lists, but it would be longer since you definitely need a flatmap for a and b, and either a flatmap or map for c.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a cleaner version with higher order function." :time 1566479152 :type "comment" :score 0)) (https://hacker-news\.firebaseio\.com/v0/item/20770710\.json (:by "11235813213455" :id "20770710" :kids (20772066 20770810) :parent "20767564" :text "the a:b notation for JS is still in proposal phase <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-slice-notation&#x2F;pull&#x2F;32\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-slice-notation&#x2F;pull&#x2F;32</a>, but I&#x27;ll use it below to create ranges<p>I don&#x27;t understand your `+0.5`, I&#x27;ve written below the transcription for your description<p><pre><code>    [...1:30].map(a =&gt;

I think it&#x27;s not unreasonable to answer the headline question with &quot;because they&#x27;re stubborn&quot;.<p>Their games look crap, not because of a lack of resources but because of a disrespect for visual design (it&#x27;s not even &quot;art&quot;, they could make a better looking game with colored squares).

Any $10&#x2F;hour freelance game artist can tell him that the problem with the games is a mismatch in detail, between background and characters, between resolution and texture detail. This makes tiles look either blurry or covered in white noise and together with a sever lack of contrast, makes the game look flat and unlit.<p>Solving that doesn&#x27;t require hiring expensive artists, it first involves acknowledging there&#x27;s an issue at the core that can&#x27;t be solved by sticking stuff on top of it. I see zero patience or passion for that and that&#x27;s why their games look the same as 25 years ago (and I could argue, <i>worse</i>, since higher resolution doesn&#x27;t do them any favors).<p>Again, I have no problem with their games and them looking like they do but going into defense here is a battle they can&#x27;t win.
